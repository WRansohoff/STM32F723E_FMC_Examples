# TFT Initialization Example

This STM32F723E Discovery Kit example demonstrates how to send commands and data over an "8080" parallel display interface using the FMC peripheral.

It sends a minimal series of initialization commands and turns on the display's backlight, but it does not draw any display data. So if you run this example, you should see a colorful static fuzz on the display.
